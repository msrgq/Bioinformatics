Three bacterial genomes were downloaded from the NCBI nucleotide database.
To keep the analysis general, they are referred to simply as:
Genome 1
Genome 2
Genome 3
A Python program with a graphical user interface (Tkinter) was developed.
The tool performs the following steps:
Loads a genome sequence from a FASTA file.
Scans the sequence for IRs of length 4, 5, or 6 nucleotides.
Allows a spacer region between the left and right arms (up to 500 bp).
Identifies IR pairs where:
Right_arm = reverse complement(Left_arm)
Records for each IR:
IR length
IR sequence
Left arm start and end positions
Right arm start and end positions
Spacer length between arms
Output Format
For each genome, results were saved to:
<filename>_inverted_repeats.txt
Each line contains a single IR pair and its coordinates.

Results:
Genome 1

Number of inverted repeats detected: 12677
IRs were distributed evenly across the genome.
The majority were 4 bp repeats, which is expected due to random sequence occurrence.
No significant clustering of IRs was observed.

Genome 2

Number of inverted repeats detected: 14322
Short IRs were frequent, while 6 bp IRs were uncommon.
Several IR pairs were separated by hundreds to thousands of base pairs, suggesting possible transposon boundaries.

Genome 3

Number of inverted repeats detected: 23864
This genome showed clusters of repeated 5 bp IRs, which may represent insertion hotspots.
Certain IR motifs appeared multiple times in close proximity, consistent with possible mobile genetic elements.
